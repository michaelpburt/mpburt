				<p>Dad arrived around 8:00 PM on Wednesday night. The plan was to travel down to 
				Silverton, take the 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_and_Silverton_Narrow_Gauge_Railroad">
				Silverton-Durango Narrow Gauge Railway</a> to the Needleton stop, and then get off and 
				hike up Chicago Basin.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Luckily the spirit that has cursed most of my dad's airport travel was not conjured 
				and he had a safe and on time flight. We went to bed immediately because we had a long, 
				long day in front of us. We got on the road by about 3:00 AM the following morning and 
				had a pretty nice ride down to Gunnison where we had some breakfast at the W Cafe (which 
				has an <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102185549377772517553/@38.5448119,-106.9266549,3a,75y/data=!3m7!1e2!3m5!1s-HFrOUwx_f54%2FVNnEapPcmpI%2FAAAAAAAAAAU%2FdjNoEpOezLM!2e4!6s%2F%2Flh6.googleusercontent.com%2F-HFrOUwx_f54%2FVNnEapPcmpI%2FAAAAAAAAAAU%2FdjNoEpOezLM%2Fw203-h100-k-no%2F!7i640!8i480!6m1!1e1">awesome sign</a>).</p>

				<br>

				<p>The weather was looking a bit iffy at this point, but we had little choice but to 
				continue. My dad and I both love four wheeling, so I decided that we would take the 
				Alpine Loop in order to get to Silverton. This involved going over a 13,000ft pass on a 
				difficult shelf road. The weather was pretty crappy on the pass, making the driving a 
				little dangerous and stressful, but the scenerey made up for it. Despite a few tense 
				moments on the road, we were able to see many old mine ruins and a herd of elk way up 
				in the mountains.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Once we dropped over Engineer Pass, we came down into Animas Forks, a ghost town about 
				15-20 miles from Silverton. We walked around the ruins and took a few picures. Despite a 
				huge number of buildings, roads, and mines, the area was only populated between 1880 and 
				1920. It is pretty amazing to see the negative impacts on the land caused by less than 50 
				years of mining activity.</p>

				<br>

				<p>After Animas Forks, we drove down into Silverton. We grabbed a few last-minute supplies 
				from a gear shop in town, checked out a local store or too, and headed for the railroad. 
				The train loads on a side street right in downtown Silverton. I was really surprised how 
				"well seasoned" the train seemed. They are not kidding when they say it has been in 
				continual operation since 1882. The train ride took around 1 hour in which time we took 
				in the sights and contemplated our next few days in the back country. We folowed the 
				Animas river to Needleton stop and jumped off. There really isn't much in Needleton 
				besides a few old cabins and a water tank for filling up the locomotives as they climb 
				the hill to Silverton from Durango.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Our goal was to get to the first area with acceptable campsites and shack up for 
				the night. This ended up being a few miles in. the campsite we found for our first 
				night was really stellar. We made some dinner and hit the hay after a long day 
				traveling about 350 miles from Denver. As soon as we settled into bed, the skies 
				opened as we drifted off to the sound of rain dancing on our tent.</p>

				<p>We woke up to more rain. It had rained just about the entire night, and it was still 
				going. We waited it out until around 10:30 AM at which point we got a small window to 
				pack up our stuff. Surprisingly, given the amount of rain that had fallen, all of our 
				stuff was dry. I have a pretty beefy Mountain Hardware Trango 2 and we had a very pleasant 
				and dry night inside the spacious tent.</p>

				<br>

				<p>We ate some awesome breakfast sandwiches with eggs and bacon. It doesn't get much 
				better than that on a backpacking trip. That is officially my favorite backcountry 
				breakfast. The weather improved slightly for our hike to the upper basin. Our plan was to 
				get as close as we could to the trail leading up into Twin Lakes. There is a camping line 
				around 10,200ft, so there was no way we could get higher than that. We wanted to take it 
				easy and set up a nice camp and try and be rested for our summit day.</p>

				<br>

				<p>We had a liesurely hike up into Chicago Basin, which was lush and beautiful. We saw a 
				lot of wild flowers and the flora was thick. We had a ton of rain this year in Colorado 
				which I think contributed to how lush it was. We got up to our camp around 3:00PM and 
				set up the tent immediately. Shortly afterwards it started drizzling again... we just 
				weren't going to escape this weather. Our campsite was a little off the beaten path. 
				There were some crowds up in the basin (understandable since it was Labor Day weekend) 
				but we were able to avoid them by being deliberate in our campsite selection.</p>

				<br>

				<p>After eating a bit of food and doing a little exploring, we went to bed. We were both 
				pretty tired and we had a huge day in front of us tomorrow. We still had almost 4,000ft 
				just to get on top of any mountain. I wanted to bag all four of the 14ers in the basin, 
				which meant that I was looking at almost 7,000ft the following day. The weather was 
				improving and we fell asleep under a cloudy sky interupted occasionaly by the stars.</p>

				<p>Our intention was to get out of bed around 4:00 AM and get on the trail. Well we woke 
				up to some freezing temps, but at least there were stars in the sky. I saw a few headlamps 
				way up near Twin Lakes, but I suggested that we go back bed for another 1.5 hours in order 
				to let the sun come up and warm the temps a bit. I really did not want to be up on the 
				mountain with ice and I knew that a few rays would be all that was needed to melt off the 
				verglass.</p>

				<br>

				<p>We popped out of bed around 5:30 AM and got on the trail. The plan was for both of us 
				to hit the trail at the same time but I would power ahead of Dad and bag Eolus and North 
				Eolus by myself. I took off like a bat out of hell with the intent of climbing about 
				4,500ft in the time it took dad to do 2,000ft and we would rendevoux at Twin Lakes. Eolus 
				was a lot more challenging than I thought it would be, especially the route finding, but 
				alas, I got them both. Due to this, it took me a lot longer than I anticipated to get 
				back to our rendevoux point. We were planning on meeting around 8:30 AM, but it was closer 
				to 10:00 AM when we met back up.</p>

				<br>

				<p>At this point, we hiked up into the upper basin which held both Sunlight Peak and 
				Windom Peak. Sunlight peak is considered one of the most difficult 14ers due to its 
				extremely exposed upper reaches. I would go bag Sunlight while Dad made his way up Windom 
				and then I would race up and meet him on Windom - that was the plan at least. I found 
				Sunlight to be a lot easier than its reputation led me to believe, but I think this is 
				because I do a lot of technical rock climbing and I wasn't really fazed by the exposure. 
				Honestly, I found the most difficult part of Sunlight was the chossy nature of the rock. 
				The route finding was way easier than Eolus and it was actually a pretty fun climb. 
				Windom and Sunlight are right next to each other so Dad and I were able to stay in visual 
				contact for most of the morning which was nice.<p>

				<br>

				<p>After blazing up Sunlight, I came down and around the basin and met Dad at about 
				13,400ft up Windom. We hiked together for about 15 minutes but it looked like weather 
				moving in was a distinct possibility. We were not in a bad spot, but there were 
				definitely thunder clouds forming up near Uncompahgre and we did not want to get stuck 
				in them. For this reason, I decided to race up Windom and come back down to Dad and 
				assess the situation. It took me about 40 minutes to get the summit and return. At this 
				point, the weather had improved and Dad had made his way up to about 13,700ft. The two 
				of us set off for the summit, trying to find an easier path than the one I had just 
				done an hour earlier. We made it to about 14,000ft before the exposure got the best of 
				Dad. The route finding on Windom was not easy! There were several sections of class 3 
				that Dad powered through, but the day was getting late and we decided to head back down. 
				We did make it above 14,000ft on some serious class 3 though - not bad for a 59 year 
				old from the flatlands! Awesome job Dad! Next time I promise to take you on an easier 
				mountain :)</p>

				<br>

				<p>We made it back to camp and packed up our stuff under some much needed sunshine. We 
				got back on the trail with the intentiion of getting as close to the rail road as we 
				really could. We ended up dropping about 1,600ft and setup camp around 3 miles form the 
				trail head on an old rail grade. We had a gorgeous campsite and beatuiful weather for a 
				very pleasant evening. We polished off the rest of our beer and had a lovely evening 
				under the stars. It was a new moon and the stars were some of the best that I have ever 
				witnessed.</p>

				<p>Dad insisted that we break camp at the crack of dawn so we didn't miss our train. I 
				wasn't so worried about it, so I made some coffee and breakfast and then sent Dad down 
				the trail while I took my time breaking camp and packing up. I let him get about an hour 
				start on me and then got on the trail.</p>

				<br>

				<p>We met up around 1 mile from the trail head and at this point we both knew that we 
				could take our time and relax. We really enjoyed the mellow hike out and I even spotted 
				an Uncompahgre butterfly! We reach the train tracks with a good hour to kill. As soon as 
				our packs were off and we had changed in to some comfy clothing, I retireved our cache 
				of beers from the Animas River, Pug Ryan Dunkle. Those beers were well-deserved, and 
				well-envied by every other person (about 40) waiting with us at Needleton! We snapped 
				some great pictures of the train tracks and soaked up some sun as we waited for the 
				trian.</p>

				<br>

				<p>The train picked us up right on time. We both got a beer on the train and enjoyed the 
				outdoor gondola as we made our way up the grade to Silverton. There is some gnarly rock 
				climbing in this canyon, so I think a return trip is in my future. e made it back to 
				Silverton by noon and immediately departed for Ouray where we planned on grabbing lunch. 
				The Million Dollar Highway took our breathe away as we made our way through the San 
				Juans. We pulled into the lovely town of Ouray where we grabbed a quick lunch and hopped 
				back in the car for the long drive home.</p>

				<br>

				<p>We had originally planned to take the southern leg of the Alpine Loop back to Lake 
				City and then on to Gunnison and Denver, but given our harrowing experience on the first 
				leg, we bailed. I think we were both a little disappointed by this, so I suggested we 
				take a backroad to Gunnison from Ridgeway. We ended up going over Owl Creek Pass in the 
				San Juans. We got on Rt. 8 in Ridgeway and drove it ove rthe pass and down to Silver Jack 
				Reservoir. There is a northern trailhead to Wetterhorn and Uncompaghre off of this road, 
				but I think it involves a lot of bushwacking... fun! The coolest part of this drive was 
				the close up shots we got of Courthouse Mountain. There are some incredible mountains right 
				in this area, including Turrent Ridge and Cimaroron Ridge South. The drive back also 
				included a biblical Labor Day traffic jam on 285. Dad really couldn't believe just how bad 
				it could be. Welcome to CO! In the end, we had an awesome trip and saw some incredible places 
				in Colorado. I fell more in love with the San Juans, and I will have to return soon.</p>
