                    <br>

                    <p>The rim to rim to rim is a hike that starts on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, 
                    crosses over the Colorado River and up to the North Rim, and then comes all the 
                    way back to the South Rim. It covers about 48 miles and 10,000ft of elevation gain. 
                    It is typically completed as an ultra-marathon. I threw out the idea of doing the 
                    rim to rim to rim to a few friends throughout the summer. Most thought I was a little 
                    nuts, most of all Janna. Well fast forward to October and she is the one convincing 
                    me to do it. I was a little nervous about all that hiking, but reluctantly agreed. 
                    I had done almost 20 hikes over the summer and I thought I was up to the challenge.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Nither of us was really committed to a 6-8 week training regime, so we just 
                    kind of said fuck it. I went on a couple trail runs over the weeks leading up to 
                    the hike but not much more than that. As the date grew closer, I got more and more 
                    nervous about the distance. It peaked right as we began our hike. But before we 
                    could do that, we had to drive about 700 miles!</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>We left Denver around 3:30AM on Friday morning. the Front Range was in the 
                    middle of an early season snow storm and Vail Pass was pretty socked in at 6:00AM. 
                    By the time we made it to Grand Junction, it was all sun. The drive through Moab 
                    was beautiful. I had never driven through Utah and I was really looking forward to 
                    it.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>We made it to Grand Canyon National Park before sunset and were rewarded with 
                    some beautiful vistas of the big ditch catching the last rays of the day. We went 
                    to bed early and woke up around 1:00AM to start our big day.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>After cramming in some last minute snacks, We hit the trail at 2:30AM. We 
                    tried to carry about 100 calories per mile, so almost 5,000 calories total. I 
                    packed a mixture of different brands of gu packets, and some pita chips, 
                    cheese-itz, and Vienna fingers. For clothing, we carried a lightweight jacket, 
                    a rain coat, an emergency bivy, some medicine and such, gloves, and a beanie. 
                    Janna wore some running tights and I opted for my tried-and-true hiking pants. 
                    I think our clothing worked out great, but when I return, I think I'll just opt 
                    for a lightweight poncho. I needed my insulated jacket for about 20 minutes and 
                    I never even broke out the rain jacket. For a top layer, I wore a heavy baselayer 
                    and it worked out great. I hiked it in some nice Brooke's running shoes with flat 
                    soles. The shoes worked out great and I only got one minor blister—not bad for 
                    almost 50 miles.</p>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>We really cruised early on. We made it 10 miles before the sun rose on us 
                    somewhere past Phantom Ranch. On the north side of the river, the hiking was 
                    beautiful and easy. The trail is very kind all the way up to Supai where the 
                    elevation really kicks in. We got passed by probably 10 different people getting 
                    after the r2r2r before we reached the North Rim. We topped out on the North Rim 
                    at about 12:30PM, around 10 hours after we started. We did not go for speed on our 
                    way north becase we really wanted to conserve our energy (and joints) for the way 
                    back. We really should have had this strategy on the way back to Phantom Ranch as 
                    well, but the trail is so beautiful and mellow, we decided to jog. We made it back 
                    to the river before the sun escaped the canyon, sometime around 5:30PM. We caught 
                    a beautiful sunset from the bridge over the Colorado and then started up the final 
                    stretch. We made great time to Indian Gardens, but miles 44-48 we definitely the 
                    toughest. The last four miles gains around 3,500 ft. Normally, this is very 
                    manageable, but after a 40 mile day, it is a little rough. We pushed to the top 
                    though, and made it back to the car around 9:30PM. We made the journey in about 
                    19 hours on the dot.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Overall, the hike was well worth it. It is hard to capture the scale of the 
                    Grand Canyon, even when you are staring at it. Walls that look so close are 5,000ft 
                    tall. The trail was lovely, if a little crowded. There were a lot of parties doing 
                    the r2r2r, and I am glad that so many people are able to experience so much of the 
                    Grand Canyon. The hike, while tough, was not quite as difficult as I had imagined 
                    it would be. After doing to much elevation in Colorado over the past few years, 
                    I was pretty accustomed to grinding out big days. The trail is beautiful and in 
                    wonderful shape. The "mental game" is not really an issue—if you ever get bored 
                    or down, just look at the incredible scenery all around you. It is an extremely 
                    enjoyable hike. Having a tough and fun partner makes all the difference, too. 
                    Thanks Janna!</p>

                    <p>After getting off the trail, the first thing we wanted was hot, greasy, fatty 
                    food. We found the cafeteria open in the village and got some pretty bad pizza. 
                    It really is bad pizza if you still think it is bad after completing a 48 mile 
                    hike. The next morning we packed up, stopped for a quick picture, and made our way 
                    to Denver. We decided to drive the southern route through Durango on the way home. 
                    I had never been and the drive across Northeast Arizona was beautiful. We saw 
                    Monument Valley and Shiprock, both of which were incredible. We pulled into Denver 
                    at around 10:00PM, completing our marathon weekend. It was an awesome trip, one 
                    that I will definitely repeat!</p>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Special thanks to Janna for completely planning this, convincing me to do it, 
                    and then convincing me that I <strong>could</strong> do it!</p>
