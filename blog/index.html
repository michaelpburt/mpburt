        <p>Welp, I got fired... this sucks. </p>

        <p>I honestly did not see it coming. For the past 2 years I have been working tirelessly to get Live Power off the ground. Live Power is a startup in the energy data acquisition space. They collect data on power flows in the grid and sell the data to firms that trade in whole electricity markets. I served as Head of Operations and Analytics at Live Power, directing the movements of all field staff. I also built out the analytical backend that calibrates all of the monitors. It was a fun, if stressful, gig that taught me a lot about working in a startup environment. It wasn't my first startup, but it was certainly the one that I was most attached to.</p>

        <p>It really stinks to lose something that you feel so attached to and invested in. I was asked to resign from my position one month ago today. Initially upon recieving the news, I was filled with anger and confusion. I could not understand why the company would make such a self-destructive move: I was the primary contributor in so many areas of operations and analytics. I pretty quickly recognized the finality of the decision, and my inability to change it. I also realized that this was not a place I would want to continute working, even if I was asked to return in some capacity.</p>

        <p>As the news sunk in, I became focused on wrapping up any business I had with Live Power and assuring that there would be good terms surrounding my exit. The split was relatively easy, all considering. I moved pretty quickly into planning mode. I knew that I wanted to take an extended period off of work and focus on the personal and professional development that I had let fall by the wayside as I was laser-focused on building Live Power. So far, I have a huge skiing road trip through British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest on the calendar. I am also doing some road tripping through National Parks of the Southwest, as well as going to Argentina for 3 weeks. Unemployment isn't so bad, right?</p>

        <p>As for professional development, I am aiming to wrap up some side projects I have been toying around with for awhile. I also hope to complete some MOOC's, including the AI track at Coursera. I will continue to improve my full stack web development skills, but I would also like to work on bolstering my applied analytics toolsets. As I have been primarily embedded in the energy markets over the past 5 years, this will likely be the focus of my analytical projects. for now, I have a goal of completing 3 medium-sized projects between now and when I go back into the job market and seek out my next opportunity.</p>

        <p>The full array lessons of Live Power have not fully revelaed themselves to me yet. I certainly learned a tremendous amount during my time there, including valuable experience managing both complicated projects and dispersed teams. Perhaps the most valuable lessons will be how to select those you work with, and how to work well with those you are unable to select yourself. In my time at Live Power, I think it is fair to say that I did more than my fair share of the heavy lifting. I never resented this contribution, because I was fully invested and building something that I believed in. I cannot say that others weren't skeptical of my motivations, though. One early lesson post-layoff is understanding how my work reflects onto others, and how to message that in a self-perserving manner... yeah, I guess I am somewhat happy to be moving on.</p>
